I developed a simple clone of the classic asteroids game utilizing command design pattern, Iterator design pattern, and proxy design pattern. Summary of the game:
In this game, player controls a space-ship flying through a field of asteroids, firing missiles to destroy asteroids which threaten to collide with and  destroy  your  ship. Occasionally, enemy ships attempt to  impede  progress by firing missiles on your ship. Ship has three lives, and each life has 10 missiles at first. Space-ship can go to the space-station to get full load of missiles at any time. Just like the original game, player get points to fire the asteroids and enemy ships.
Through this assignment, I gain experience with interactive graphics and animation techniques such  as  repainting, timer-driven  animation,  collision  detection,  and object selection.
